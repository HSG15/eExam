# eExam - Online Exam App

eExam is an online exam application designed with a user-friendly Material Design interface. The app consists of two separate modules: one for administrators and another for students. LottieFiles animations enhance the visual appeal of the app. Administrators can easily upload questions to the Firebase database, while students can log in or sign up to access and answer these questions, as well as view their corresponding marks.
